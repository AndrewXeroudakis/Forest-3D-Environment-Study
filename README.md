## Task
I created this project as a final assignment for my university's Unity course.
My goals were to:
* sculpt terrain, paint textures and add details
* adjust rendering pipeline (URP/HDRP)
* adjust lighting and fog
* improve visuals by using Post Processing effects, sun glare, wind, reflection probe etc.
* use free assets and stage them in my scene
* use an FPS Controller
* add basic water
* add sound and atmosphere

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* [Unity3D 2019.4.11f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
* Visual Studio 2019
* C# 8.0
* .NET Core 3.0

## How to use
The player can move around using standard FPS movement. It has a small forest area to explore.
